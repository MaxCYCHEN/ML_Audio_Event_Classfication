# Board Test

- This script loads test data into the board using pyOCD, then the board performs inference on the data, and the script retrieves the result.
- This script can run in [NuEdgeWise](https://github.com/OpenNuvoton/NuEdgeWise).
- The MCU code is here: [M460](https://github.com/OpenNuvoton/ML_M460_SampleCode/tree/master/SampleCode/MachineLearning/ml_board_full_test)
